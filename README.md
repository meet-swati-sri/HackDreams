# HackDreams
NIOS Theme - Hack2Educate

Theme - NIOS has all the resources parents need to homeschool their children.

Ques - How will you solve the problem ?
Solution - 1) We will make the UI more user friendly and information precise so that the students and parents can use it with ease.
           2) We will provide a section where both the students and the parents can clear up their doubts about the courses 24/7.
           3) We will also try to integrate the website with other schooling platforms so that the students can easily approach the courses which suits them.
           4) We will add a feedback and review system for the students to share their feedback for improvement.
           5) We will try to add a bulletin board which will show the active scholarship programs.
